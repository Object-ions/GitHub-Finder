# GitHub Finder

### By Moses Atia Poston

## Description

## Features

- View a list of search results with user details.
- Navigate to a detailed user profile page.
- Access users' repositories, gists, followers, and following counts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Create a `.env` file and fill it with your GitHub Token. For an explanation, watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lGcbQR4k4Y&ab_channel=JavaTCoding).
   Include in the `.env` file these fields:

```
